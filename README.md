# PruebaMeli

This is a public repository that works as an excercise and a test to apply to an IT company.
It consists on an Android Application that connects to a simple API that brings some products after serching them through the search bar.

It was made applying the MVVM architecture design pattern, and implements Android Architecture components such as Navigation, View Model, LiveData, among others.
